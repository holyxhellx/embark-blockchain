use this to test windows builds https://www.appveyor.com/
https://coveralls.io/

* better error message for lack of funds

* suport --password

idea: contribute commander to solc to minimize dependencies

api:
- get embark file (for __dirname files)
- get file (returns object {filename: content: function(){}, pathname})

npm -g install dependo

// TODO: find a way to do npm install without using cd

slowdown:
- the slowness of the console might be due to the console eval

philosophy:
* decouple modules
* should work in both os and browser
* filesystem and os functionality abstracted
* throw exceptions instead of exiting abruptly
* always use async

https://github.com/cryptape/ethereum-bootstrap

https://www.npmjs.com/package/globule
https://www.npmjs.com/package/micromatch

* idea support truffle tests
* pudding to embarkjs bindings

go through each file, see what could be incompatible with web and abstract it

* keep track of onDeploy cmds that ran
"onDeploy": [
  "SimpleStorage.set(250)"
]

better code:
* can move deploy tracker to config or some 'general environment state'
* can abstract the file system
* utils class
* write pretty json could be abstracted
* modules don't deal with FS directly, instead they write in a module
* logger needs almost aways
* move eval code to its own module
* need to re-evaluate the exit calls

* the evals can be mostly avoided by re-initializing the contract code

todo:
* update compile plugin

embark online
* find how to load/save gist/github projects directly from console as a file system
** and/or save projects directly in swarm or ipfs
* test running embark directly in the browser / packaging
* replace fs with a web version to read github
* the memory fs should work in node just the same

debug Contract
* option to take a transaction and debug it
* opens a browser window with remix

BUG:
* AnotherStorage keeps redeploying
* does ipfs api work without jquery

important:
* need to add 'auto' by default to tests
* if contract doesn't deploy it should give an error in the specs

tutorials
* token factory
* decentralized twitter
* decentralized forum

* flow js to solidity converter
* add redeploy cmd
* put embarkjs in tests
* need a 'reset' for the tests
* track asset changes (e.g hash file contents and put in .embark)
* implement redeploy command
* embark deploy cmd is missing
* support specifying a different web3 config for the client side
* keep cmd history for console

bugs:
* if $Contract is mispelled there is a big error
* if the contract has a bug compiling there is no proper error
* doing 'embark upload' does not result in a clear error message
* running embark upload is showing embark-babel

* tolerate lack of storage.json and comunication.json files
* detect if IPFS/whisper is disabled
* interesting problem: if the compiler changes, it makes it look like the contract did too

* developing/testing with different accounts can be still be a bit of an issue

create storage.json
-> configure ipfs executable location
-> configure port and host
-> per environment

============

V addFileToPipeline
V*is this working with css and other files????
V* test images
V** read file stream besides text content
V make sure to tolerate embark.json that don't have plugins
V fix specs
V make plugins work in Test
V make test work again


* plugin shouldn't crash the whole thing
* include what is the current environment
* auto seems to be limiting gas to 700k

============

* need to read file stream

idea:
* allow a embark app, to be published as a NPM package! for use in javascript


= supported plugins
* compiler
** viper plugin
** lll
* services
* extend embarkjs
* embarkjs provider
* blockchain client
* command line commands and arguments or extensions
* on test

* need to generate maps otherwise it's really hard to use this
* an error in contract deployment shouldn't continue the build process

* editing a html file (title) is not redeploying (might just be chrome)
* add redeploy command
* rebuild only the set of files necessary

embark command to generate abi file of a contract

plugin funcitonality to add
* option to always keep default behaviour
* extend deployment
* message bus (e.g tell embark to deploy something)
* detect adding plugins
* redux style chrome extension
** shows ethereum calls being made

//import "token2.sol";

//contract MyToken is Token(1000) {}
//contract MyToken is Token2(1000) {}

//contract MyToken is Token {
//
//  function MyToken(uint supply) Token(supply) {
//  }
//
//}

embark console

* run testrpc is no server is found
* need to check webserver for real
* support connecting through ipc

plugins:
* display cleaner messae when plugin is not available
* isolate plugin errors
* add some sort of API versioning
* don't allow plugins to crash app


embark plugin add

* add welcome to embark ascii
* need to speed up console/dashboard

test
* embark demo, file creation
* test template generator
* update dependencies
* create a set of test suites to test the different features

* create a testing protocol
** e.g create demo and new app
** check if main commands are all working

* getting error when creatin new dapp, it's possible the copy process is async

* detect running commands in a non-embark directory

* add gifs to documentation
* more graphics
* add ascii art to some commands

* detect is arguments given exceed or are less than expected in constructor

* get rid of grunt if possible

* follow instructions in docs
* add embark swarm for convenience

* communication layers
** stop listening to topics

* support quick ABI UI generation
** support react integration

* support exit as quit command also


* plugin options

* add to: to whisper

* supported react

* save logs in .embark

 "html/*": ["app/html/*"],

* use solc loadRemoteVersion functionality

* do a test api for whisper and ipfs

* support es6, esx, etc..

* write plugins

https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth-lightwallet

* test contract import

* support a port option for embark run

* make dashboard optional



* support creating a boilerplate app in the same directory
** useful for migrations

* ga to find relationships between opcodes

* use development settings in simulator
* or add a simulator environment

* contract not redeploying when gas config changes

* save codeHash or code itself in the chains file
* save transactionHash in the chains file

* detect typical error messages and add explanations
